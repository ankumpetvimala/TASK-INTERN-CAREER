Description: Create a CI/CD pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment processes for a web application using Jenkins, Docker, and GitHub/GitLab.

Title: Task 1: Setup Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Pipeline

Introduction:
Create a CI/CD pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment processes for a web application using Jenkins, Docker, and GitHub/GitLab.

System Requirements:
2.1 EFS File System Setup:
Provision an Amazon EFS file system within the desired AWS region.
Define the appropriate storage capacity based on the expected file system usage and growth.
Configure the EFS file system to utilize the desired availability zones to ensure high availability and durability.
Enable file system encryption for data security.
Determine the performance mode (general purpose or Max I/O) based on workload requirements.
Establish file system lifecycle policies for automated data management.
2.2 EC2 Instances:
Launch and configure one or more EC2 instances within the same VPC as the EFS file system.
Establish proper network connectivity and security settings between the EC2 instances and the EFS file system.
Ensure that the EC2 instances have the necessary permissions to access the EFS file system.
Implement appropriate instance types and sizes based on the workload demands.
2.3 Mounting and Access Permissions:
Mount the EFS file system onto the EC2 instances using the necessary mount targets.
Implement a consistent and reliable method for mounting the file system during instance boot-up.
Configure access permissions to enable proper file sharing and collaboration.
Define user-level access controls and roles to manage read, write, and execute permissions for files and directories.
Implement security best practices to restrict unauthorized access to the file system.
2.4 Scalability and Elasticity:
Design the file storage system with scalability in mind, ensuring it can handle increased workload and data growth.
Implement auto-scaling capabilities for both the EC2 instances and the EFS file system to accommodate changing demands.
Monitor the system's performance and utilization to proactively adjust resources as needed.
Utilize AWS services such as CloudWatch, CloudFormation, or AWS CLI to automate scalability and elasticity.
2.5 Testing and Validation:
Develop a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure the file storage system functions as intended.
Conduct performance tests to evaluate the system's ability to handle various file sizes, concurrent users, and workloads.
Perform integration tests to verify seamless file sharing across multiple instances.
Implement appropriate monitoring and logging mechanisms to identify and resolve potential issues.
