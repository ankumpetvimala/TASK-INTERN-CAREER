**Adding Webhook in Github**

Go to your GitHub repository.

Under "Settings," select "Webhooks."

Click on "Add webhook."

Set the payload URL to your Jenkins server's URL followed by /github-webhook/.

Select the events you want to trigger the webhook (e.g., Push events).

Optionally, you can set up a secret and configure Jenkins to validate the webhook payload using this secret.

Save your webhook configuration.
